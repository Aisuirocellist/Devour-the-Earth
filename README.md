# Introduction: Devour the Earth

## Background Story

Far across the galaxy, the Earth has been discovered by a hivemind of space monster parasites. However, being a hivemind is not fun, as everything on their planet looks the same; they are tired of seeing and eating platinum every single day. Excitingly, they discovered that the Earth contains elements that they have never seen before, and the core is full of nickel and iron. That must be tasty! So the aliens, ready to do anything to sate their boredom, set out on a journey across the galaxy to devour it. However, humanity’s advanced technology has alerted them to the incoming threat, so they rally around the planet to defend it. To reach the Earth’s core, the aliens must assimilate ships to grow their army and Devour The Earth!
