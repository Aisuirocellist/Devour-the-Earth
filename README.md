Devour the Earth is a Space Invaders-inspired shooter built in Unity that focuses on persistent progression through failure. Players control disposable hivemind entities, assimilating enemy ships across runs to gradually overwhelm an escalating planetary defense system.

## Gameplay Overview / Core Mechanics

When you press the Play button of the game, you'll enter the Hub, which is empty at the moment. Now, when you press the Attack button, located at the bottom right of the Hub, the invasion will begin. To devour the Earth, you must attack the Earth and lower its health, which is quantified at the bottom of the screen as the blue HP bar. You can move yourself with WASD, aim by moving the mouse, and fire a bullet with the left mouse click/hold.

However, you are a mere single hivemind entity, too weak to destroy the Earth that is firmly protected by its space force. Fortunately, you can use your hivemind assimilation ability to collect the enemy ship fragments, send them to the hivemind base, and assimilate them into minions so that the next hivemind entity can use them. Every minion can be found in the Hub, where you can drag it to the radar-like space on the left part of the Hub to use it on the next invasion. Although you can assimilate as many ships as you want, they disappear from the Hub once destroyed.

As you get stronger, you will notice that every time you lower the Earth's HP by 25%, it sends out stronger and more diverse ships. In these 4 different phases, the Earth will introduce a basic enemy, a kamikaze enemy, an electric enemy, and a laser enemy, respectively. Except for the basic minion (and other bullet-type minions), which you can fire their bullets with the left mouse click/hold, the other three types of minions require different inputs. For more details, press the CONTROLS button in the Hub.

## Technical Notes
- Built in **Unity**
- Target platforms: **WebGL** and **Windows**
- Due to a WebGL limitation, the electric enemy's orb SFX visual effect does not render correctly on itch.io. Hence, the Windows executable is recommended.
